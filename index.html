        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>A recent study compared AI-generated research ideas with those from human scientists. AI tools, including large language models, produced ideas that were rated more original and exciting, but human ideas were considered more feasible.</p>
        <p>This study demonstrates AI's potential for quick innovation but also raises concerns about subjective evaluation and the challenge of fairly comparing AI and human creativity.</p>
        <p>The future role of AI in scientific research is still being debated.</p>
